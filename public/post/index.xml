      <description>After my 14 year-old neighbor showed me the website she built, I decided enough is enough, it&amp;rsquo;s time I show her I&amp;rsquo;m better than she is and I can build my own website too.
I researched several of the most popular DIY website creation tools (e.g. WordPress, Squarespace) and ultimately settled on using HUGO (an open source static site generator) to build my site and Netlify to for web hosting services.</description>

      <description>This was my first project using R. So the start of the project involved installing and setting up R and R Studio, and familarizing myself with how to install/load packages, setup version control (using renv), and performing basic analysis and modeling tasks in the R ecosystem.

      <description>The prescribed objective for this project was to outline and then implement a data science process—like CRISP-DM—resulting in a model that could reliably predict whether or not a customer would default on their loan(s) from their demographic information, as well as six months worth of data on their billing and payment history.
