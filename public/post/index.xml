      <description>While doing research for another project, I stumbled across a tutorial on how to build your own static website using Hugo (open source) and adding content using markdown files. I decided to try it. What you&amp;rsquo;re looking at is the result.

      <description>This was my first project using R. So the start of the project involved installing and setting up R and R Studio, and familarizing myself with how to install/load packages, setup version control (using renv), and performing basic analysis and modeling tasks in the R ecosystem.

      <description>Project Summary Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a lack of self control, need of a reminder that other people are still out there, or the outcome of some nefarious dark patterns but I have definitely spent more time then I can justify reading product reviews. A few have made me laugh out loud and sometimes they seem useful. But, in my own case at least, I&amp;rsquo;m not confident product reviews make a real difference in my purchasing behavior.</description>

      <description>What is market basket analysis? Market basket analysis (also known as affinity analysis) is specific implementation of association rule learning/mining&amp;ndash;an unsupervised machine learning that seeks to uncover potentially valuable relationships (associations) between the items/products consumers buy from point of sale transaction data . For example, a grocery store might use market basket analysis to discover that 40% of the time when their customers buy cereal, they also buy bananas. Businesses used market basket analysis for things like:</description>
